This repository contains the complete codebase for Jidapa's Deep Learning-based Object Detection Realtime Project.

## Project Overview
- **Description**: This project captures screen recordings or live video streams from personal CCTV cameras via a custom application and performs realtime object detection using the YOLOv8n model. It enables monitoring and automatic recognition of objects in video feeds, making it useful for security and surveillance applications.
- **Goal**: Achieve efficient and accurate realtime object detection with minimal latency on accessible hardware like NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs or equivalent.

## Libraries and Tools Used
- **Data Analysis**: `pandas`, `NumPy` for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Image Processing**: `opencv-python` (`cv2`) to handle video frame extraction and display.
- **Pretrained Model**: YOLOv8n, the lightweight YOLOv8 architecture optimized for realtime performance.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: `pytorch`, `ultralytics`, and `yolo` for model loading, inference, and utilities.

## Repository Structure
- `main.py` The main application script that initializes the video capture from CCTV, loads the YOLOv8n model, processes video frames, and displays realtime detection results.
- `utils/realtime_extended.py` Contains utility functions and extended features such as advanced frame processing, detection postprocessing, and video stream handling.
- `requirements.txt` Lists all Python dependencies and versions required to run the project smoothly.
- `example_result_object_detection_realtime.ipynb` Jupyter notebook demonstrating example outputs, performance metrics, and visualization from a demo run.

## Usage Notes
- Ensure that your video input device (CCTV or video file) is correctly configured in `main.py`.
- The model weights are loaded automatically via the `ultralytics` YOLOv8n interface; no manual download required.
- Real-time performance depends on your hardware â€” a CUDA-enabled GPU significantly accelerates detection.
- Customize detection confidence thresholds and other parameters in `main.py` as needed.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
